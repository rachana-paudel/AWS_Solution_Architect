#### EBS( Elastic Block Storage) Volume
+ It is an network drive that we can attach to our instance while they run
+ we cannot attach 1 EBS to 2 or more EC2 instance but we can attach 2 or more EBS to a single instance
+ EBS allows us to store(persist) data even after the termination of ec2 instance
+ They can only be mounted(making a file system available for access in a particular location within a directory tree) to one instance at a time ( at the CCP level)
