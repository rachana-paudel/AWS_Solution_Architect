#### Scalability & High Availability
+ Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads 
by adapting. 
+ There are two kinds of scalability:
+ Vertical Scalability
+ Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
+ Scalability is linked but different to High Availability
+ Scalability refers to a system's ability to handle increasing loads by adding resources or scaling out horizontally across multiple nodes.

+ High availability, on the other hand, is concerned with ensuring that a system remains operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically measured as uptime.

1. Vertical Scalability:

+ Involves increasing the size or capacity of a single instance or server.
+ Commonly used for non-distributed systems such as databases.
+ Example: Upgrading from a small instance like t2.micro to a larger instance like t2.large.
+ Services like RDS (Relational Database Service) and ElastiCache support vertical scalability.
+ There is typically a limit to how much you can vertically scale due to hardware constraints.

2. Horizontal Scalability:

+ Involves increasing the number of instances or systems for an application.
+ Commonly used for distributed systems, such as web applications.
+ Easily achieved with cloud offerings like Amazon EC2, where you can spin up multiple instances as needed.
+ Horizontal scalability allows the workload to be distributed across multiple machines, increasing overall capacity and redundancy.

#### High Availability (HA) and Horizontal Scaling:

+ High Availability (HA):

    + Often coupled with horizontal scaling.
    + Involves running the system in at least 2 data centers (Availability Zones).
    + Goal: Survive a data center loss to maintain operational continuity.

+ Passive HA:
    + Example: RDS Multi-AZ.
    + Standby resources are activated during failures.

+ Active HA with Horizontal Scaling:
    + Distributes workload across multiple active instances.
    + Load balancers manage traffic distribution for scalability and redundancy.

#### Types of Scaling
+ Vertical Scaling:
    + Increasing the size of a single EC2 instance by upgrading its specifications.
    + Example: Upgrading from a small instance like t2.nano to a large one like u-12tb1.metal, which offers significantly more resources.

+ Horizontal Scaling:
    + Increasing the number of EC2 instances to handle increased load or traffic.
    + Achieved using Auto Scaling Groups, which automatically adjust the number of instances based on predefined conditions.

+ Load Balancer:
    + Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure optimal resource utilization and availability.
    + Helps in horizontal scaling by evenly distributing workload among instances.

+ High Availability:
    + Ensures continuous operation and minimizes downtime by deploying EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
    + Auto Scaling Groups can be configured to launch instances in multiple AZs for redundancy and fault tolerance.
    + Load Balancers can also be set up to route traffic to instances in different AZs for improved availability and reliability.


#### Load Balancing
+ Load Balances are servers that forward traffic to multiple 
servers (e.g., EC2 instances) downstream

#### Why use a load balancer?

+ Spread load across multiple downstream instances: Balances incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from being overwhelmed.

+ Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application: Simplifies access for users by providing a single entry point to the application.

+ Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances: Detects and redirects traffic away from failed or unhealthy servers, ensuring continuous service availability.

+ Do regular health checks to your instances: Monitors the health of downstream servers and removes unhealthy instances from the pool of available servers.

+ Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites: Terminates SSL connections at the load balancer, reducing the processing load on backend servers and simplifying SSL certificate management.

+ Enforce stickiness with cookies: Maintains session persistence by directing subsequent requests from a client to the same backend server, which can be useful for stateful applications.

+ High availability across zones: Distributes traffic across multiple data centers or availability zones to improve reliability and fault tolerance.

+ Separate public traffic from private traffic: Acts as a gateway, separating incoming public traffic from internal/private traffic, enhancing security and network segmentation.

#### Why use Elastic Load Balancing?
+ Managed Load Balancer: ELB is a managed service provided by AWS, meaning AWS handles the setup, maintenance, and upgrades of the load balancer infrastructure.

+ Guaranteed Working: AWS guarantees the reliability and availability of ELB, ensuring that it remains operational and performs as expected.

+ Maintenance and High Availability: AWS manages the high availability of ELB, ensuring that it is fault-tolerant and available even during upgrades or maintenance activities.

+ Limited Configuration Knobs: ELB abstracts away much of the complexity of load balancer configuration, offering a simplified interface with only a few configuration options, making it easier to use.

+ Cost-Efficient: While setting up your own load balancer might cost less initially, using ELB saves significant effort as AWS handles the operational overhead, resulting in potential long-term cost savings.

+ Integration with AWS Services: ELB seamlessly integrates with various AWS offerings and services such as EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch, Route 53, AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), and AWS Global Accelerator, simplifying the setup and management of complex architectures.

#### Health Checks
+  Health Checks are crucial for Load Balancers
+ They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to 
are available to reply to requests
+ The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
+ If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy

#### Types of Load Balancer
1. Classic Load Balancer (CLB) (vI-old generation)-2009:
+ External (Public) CLB: Routes incoming traffic from the internet to the instances in your VPC. It has a public DNS name and public IP addresses.

+ Internal (Private) CLB: Routes traffic between the instances within the same VPC. It does not have a public DNS name or public IP addresses and is accessible only within the VPC.

2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)  (v2 - new generation) â€“ 2016:
+ External (Public) ALB: Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple targets in multiple availability zones. It has a public DNS name and public IP addresses.

+ Internal (Private) ALB: Distributes traffic to targets within the same VPC, making it ideal for internal services. It does not have a public DNS name or public IP addresses.

+ Layer 7 (HTTP) Load Balancing: ALBs operate at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model, enabling them to intelligently distribute incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic to backend targets.

+ Load Balancing to Multiple HTTP Applications Across Machines (Target Groups): ALBs support routing traffic to multiple target groups, allowing you to direct requests to different sets of instances based on defined criteria, such as path patterns or hostnames.

+ Load Balancing to Multiple Applications on the Same Machine (e.g., Containers): ALBs can efficiently balance traffic to multiple applications running on the same instance, making them suitable for containerized environments where multiple services may coexist on a single host.

+ Support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket: ALBs offer native support for HTTP/2, enabling faster and more efficient communication between clients and servers. Additionally, they can handle WebSocket traffic, which is crucial for real-time communication applications like chat applications or online gaming.

+ Support for Redirects: ALBs can be configured to perform redirects, allowing you to seamlessly redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS for improved security or to different URLs as needed. This feature is particularly useful for enforcing HTTPS for secure communication between clients and servers.


Certainly! Application Load Balancers (ALBs) offer advanced routing capabilities that make them an ideal choice for modern microservices and container-based applications. Here's a detailed explanation:
1. Routing Tables to Different Target Groups:
    + ALBs support routing traffic to different target groups based on various criteria, including URL path, hostname, query strings, and headers. This allows for fine-grained control over how incoming requests are distributed to backend services.

2. Routing Based on Path in URL:
    + ALBs can route requests based on the path specified in the URL. For example, requests to "example.com/users" can be directed to one target group handling user-related services, while requests to "example.com/posts" can be routed to another target group handling post-related services.

3. Routing Based on Hostname in URL:
    + ALBs can also route requests based on the hostname specified in the URL. For instance, requests to "one.example.com" can be sent to one target group, while requests to "other.example.com" can be directed to a different target group, allowing for segregation of services based on subdomains.

4. Routing Based on Query String, Headers:
    ALBs support routing based on query string parameters and headers in the HTTP request. This enables dynamic routing decisions based on specific parameters or headers, such as user IDs, authentication tokens, or content types.

5. Suitability for Microservices & Container-Based Applications:    
    + ALBs are well-suited for microservices and container-based architectures due to their flexible routing capabilities and seamless integration with container orchestration platforms like Docker and Amazon ECS. They can efficiently distribute traffic across multiple containers or microservices running on different instances or tasks.

6. Port Mapping Feature for ECS:
    + ALBs offer a port mapping feature specifically designed for Amazon ECS, allowing containers within ECS tasks to dynamically bind to different ports. This eliminates the need to manage port conflicts manually and simplifies the deployment of containerized applications.

7. Comparison with Classic Load Balancers (CLBs):
    + In contrast to ALBs, which support multiple routing criteria and flexible target group configurations, CLBs are limited in their routing capabilities. To achieve similar functionality as ALBs, multiple CLBs would be required per application, leading to increased complexity and management overhead.

##### ALB Target group
1. EC2 Instances (Managed by an Auto Scaling Group) - HTTP:
    + ALB can distribute incoming HTTP traffic to EC2 instances within an Auto Scaling Group. This allows for dynamic scaling of resources based on demand, ensuring consistent performance and availability of the application.

2. ECS Tasks (Managed by ECS Itself) - HTTP:
    + ALB seamlessly integrates with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) to route HTTP traffic to containers running as tasks. This simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications, providing efficient traffic distribution across ECS tasks.

3. Lambda Functions - HTTP Request is Translated into a JSON Event:
    + ALB supports routing HTTP requests directly to AWS Lambda functions. When a request is received, ALB converts it into a JSON event and invokes the corresponding Lambda function. This enables serverless architectures and allows for seamless integration of Lambda functions with HTTP-based applications.

4. IP Addresses - Must Be Private IPs:
    + ALB can route traffic to IP addresses, but they must be private IPs. This is particularly useful for directing traffic to backend resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), ensuring secure communication within the network.

5. Routing to Multiple Target Groups:
    + ALB offers the flexibility to route incoming requests to multiple target groups based on defined rules. This enables sophisticated traffic management scenarios, such as blue-green deployments, canary releases, or A/B testing, where different versions of the application are served from separate target groups.

6. Health Checks at the Target Group Level:
    + Health checks for ALB are configured at the target group level. ALB periodically checks the health of individual targets within a target group to ensure that only healthy instances, tasks, or Lambda functions receive traffic. This ensures high availability and reliability of the application by automatically removing unhealthy targets from the load balancer's rotation.

##### Application Load Balancer (v2) Good to Know
+  Fixed hostname (XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
+  The application servers donâ€™t see the IP of the client directly
+  The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For
+ We can also get Port (X-Forwarded-Port) and proto (X-Forwarded-Proto)

3. Network Load Balancer (NLB) (v2 - new generation) â€“ 2017:
+ External (Public) NLB: Routes TCP, TLS, and UDP traffic from clients over the internet to a target, typically an instance in a VPC. It has a public IP address.

+ TCP and UDP Traffic Forwarding: NLB can distribute both TCP and UDP traffic, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and services.

+ High Request Handling Capacity: NLB is designed to handle millions of requests per second, making it ideal for high-traffic applications where scalability is critical.

+ Low Latency: NLB offers lower latency compared to Application Load Balancers (ALB), typically around 100 milliseconds, which can be advantageous for latency-sensitive applications.

+ Static IP per Availability Zone (AZ): NLB provides a static IP address per Availability Zone, allowing clients to connect to the same IP address regardless of which backend instance they are routed to. This simplifies DNS management and ensures consistent connectivity.

+ Support for Elastic IP: NLB supports assigning Elastic IP addresses, which can be useful for whitelisting specific IP addresses or for maintaining a stable IP address for your application.

+ Extreme Performance for TCP and UDP: NLB is optimized for extreme performance and is well-suited for handling TCP and UDP traffic at scale.

+ Not Included in AWS Free Tier: It's important to note that NLB usage is not covered under the AWS free tier, so charges will apply for usage.

+ Internal (Private) NLB: Routes traffic to targets within the same VPC, often used for internal-facing services. It does not have a public IP address.

<img src='images/network load balancer.png' height='100%' width='100%' >

##### Target Group (EC2 Instances):

+ This target group is configured to route traffic to EC2 instances.
    + Targets are specified by their instance IDs (e.g., i-1234567890abcdef0).
    + The NLB forwards traffic to these instances based on the rules defined in the associated listener.

+ Target Group (IP Addresses):
    + This target group is configured to route traffic to specific IP addresses.
    + Targets are specified by their private IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.118, 10.0.4.21).
    + These IP addresses must be private IPs within the VPC where the NLB resides.
    + Like with instances, the NLB forwards traffic to these IP addresses based on the rules defined in the associated listener.


4. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)-2020:
+ External (Public) GWLB: Routes traffic at the network layer (Layer 3) and operates with public IP addresses to direct traffic from clients over the internet to targets within a VPC.

+ Internal (Private) GWLB: Operates within the VPC and directs traffic internally, usually between services or instances within the same VPC. It does not have public IP addresses.

+ Deployment of Third-Party Network Virtual Appliances: The Gateway Load Balancer enables you to deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of third-party network virtual appliances in AWS. These appliances can include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), deep packet inspection (DPI) systems, and other similar network security or traffic management tools.

+ Layer 3 Operation (Network Layer): Unlike other AWS load balancers like the Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) which operate at Layer 7 (Application Layer) and Layer 4 (Transport Layer) respectively, the Gateway Load Balancer operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer), specifically dealing with IP packets.

+ Functions Combination: The Gateway Load Balancer combines several critical functions:

    + Transparent Network Gateway: It serves as a single entry and exit point for all traffic within your network infrastructure. This means all traffic flows through the load balancer, providing a centralized point for managing network traffic.
    + Load Balancer: It distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of your virtual appliances, ensuring efficient utilization and scalability of your network security and traffic management resources.
+ Protocol Usage: The Gateway Load Balancer utilizes the GENEVE (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) protocol on port 6081. GENEVE is a tunneling protocol used for encapsulating traffic between network devices.
