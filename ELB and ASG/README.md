#### Scalability & High Availability
+ Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads 
by adapting. 
+ There are two kinds of scalability:
+ Vertical Scalability
+ Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
+ Scalability is linked but different to High Availability
+ Scalability refers to a system's ability to handle increasing loads by adding resources or scaling out horizontally across multiple nodes.

+ High availability, on the other hand, is concerned with ensuring that a system remains operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically measured as uptime.
