#### Scalability & High Availability
+ Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads 
by adapting. 
+ There are two kinds of scalability:
+ Vertical Scalability
+ Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
+ Scalability is linked but different to High Availability
+ Scalability refers to a system's ability to handle increasing loads by adding resources or scaling out horizontally across multiple nodes.

+ High availability, on the other hand, is concerned with ensuring that a system remains operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically measured as uptime.

1. Vertical Scalability:

+ Involves increasing the size or capacity of a single instance or server.
+ Commonly used for non-distributed systems such as databases.
+ Example: Upgrading from a small instance like t2.micro to a larger instance like t2.large.
+ Services like RDS (Relational Database Service) and ElastiCache support vertical scalability.
+ There is typically a limit to how much you can vertically scale due to hardware constraints.

2. Horizontal Scalability:

+ Involves increasing the number of instances or systems for an application.
+ Commonly used for distributed systems, such as web applications.
+ Easily achieved with cloud offerings like Amazon EC2, where you can spin up multiple instances as needed.
+ Horizontal scalability allows the workload to be distributed across multiple machines, increasing overall capacity and redundancy.

#### High Availability (HA) and Horizontal Scaling:

+ High Availability (HA):

    + Often coupled with horizontal scaling.
    + Involves running the system in at least 2 data centers (Availability Zones).
    + Goal: Survive a data center loss to maintain operational continuity.

+ Passive HA:
    + Example: RDS Multi-AZ.
    + Standby resources are activated during failures.

+ Active HA with Horizontal Scaling:
    + Distributes workload across multiple active instances.
    + Load balancers manage traffic distribution for scalability and redundancy.
